## Course- Creative Python for Beginners
### General Description
##### This course would be taught to Sophmores preferably for the duration of one academic year. The course would cover basic Python skills that would allow students to produce
##### work with artistic content. We would cover basic drawing with turtle, which would enable students to draw and express themselves visually; we would cover 
##### dictionaries and lists, so that students might compose written pieces of any genre that they chose. Since the focus would be creativity, we would work closelly with Art
##### and English Teachers. The ultimate goal would be for the students to have fun doing what they like while learning Python. 

### Target Audience
##### As stated above, the target students would be Sophmores because our school offers Intro CS for all Freshmen, but the only other course offered is AP CSP which is offered 
#####to all the grades above 9. 

### Where the Course fits 
##### Students taking the AP course in the Sophmore year will run out of CS options in the subsequent grades. Therefore, if we can insert the Python course in the 10th grade,
##### students will be better prepared to move to the AP class. Not that this would be a Pre-AP class, but exposing students to more coding opportunities will reinforce their 
##### skills and encouraged them to pursue CS further.

### Raison D'tre
##### I am a firm beliver in CS for all and the drive for equity in of our field. The fact that minorities are underrepresented is something that concerns me. We all know that 
##### for different reasons even extremely bright girls turn away from STEM as the move up in HS. What seemed so easy for them, and appeared to be a career path suddenly loses its
##### appeal. So the would-be Engineers, Computer Scientists, Physicists end up choosingto go to other careers, veering away from the Sciences. I teach in an Engineering and 
##### Architecture school, but I don't see too many of the girls choosing those careers in College.
