### Topic:  Planned Obsolescence of Smartphones

### Description:
##### Phones nowadays are not made like they used to.  The first smartphones had features, such as removable batteries and had better software support.  Companies, like Samsung ##### and Apple, now make phones that are meant to only be used for a few years due to various factors, like planned update expirations, non-removable batteries, more delicate ##### screens, non-availability of easily user-replaceable parts, etc.

### Program:  
### Use Snap to ask a series of questions about current phone, such as:
##### Current satisfaction
##### Manufacturer
##### Year
##### Model
##### Phone condition
##### Software version
##### Jealousy to upgrade

If a certain number of conditions are met, then tell the user itâ€™s time to change the phone along with cost of new one.
