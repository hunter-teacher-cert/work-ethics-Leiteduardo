* Final project

Add your final project files here. Remember
- You must have a pdf file with your actual submission
- You can add other files as needed (in any format you'd like)
- Every participant must upload the same pdf file

Part 1:
Folder: final_project
File name: proposal.md or proposal.pdf
Write up in an .md or .pdf file (I'd prefer .md) a proposal for what you want to do for your  final project. The project is to be done by groups of two (and one group of 3).
Include:
1. The names of the participants.
2. A description of the issue you are going to tackle
3. A description of how you will provide a program as part of the
   project (which can be in any language, even untraditional ones like
   using a spreadsheet for data analysis)
Make sure that all group members have a copy of this file in their
repo.
Take a look at Communications of the ACM for ideas (particularly the
viewpoints): https://cacm.acm.org/

Topic:  Planned Obsolescence of Smartphones

Description:
Phones nowadays are not made like they used to.  The first smartphones had features, such as removable batteries and had better software support.  Companies, like Samsung and Apple, now make phones that are meant to only be used for a few years due to various factors, like planned update expirations, non-removable batteries, more delicate screens, non-availability of easily user-replaceable parts, etc.

Program:  
Use Snap to ask a series of questions about current phone, such as:
Current satisfaction
Manufacturer
Year
Model
Phone condition
Software version
Jealousy to upgrade

If a certain number of conditions are met, then tell the user itâ€™s time to change the phone along with cost of new one.
